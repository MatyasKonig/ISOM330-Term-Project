This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(reticulate)
use_python('/Applications/anaconda3/bin/python')

import('pandas')
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{python}
import re
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt



with open('variable names.txt', 'r') as inFile: 
    #var name is txt file with variable names
	varNames = inFile.read()
	varComp = re.compile(r'--\s(\w+)')
    #use regular expression to extract var names from string
	varMatch = varComp.findall(varNames)
	df = pd.read_csv('communities.csv',names = varMatch,na_values=['?'])


#remove columns with nans
df = df.dropna(axis='columns')

#import state code file
dfState = pd.read_csv('state.txt',sep='|',header=0)
#remove two unwanted columns
dfState = dfState.drop(['STATE_NAME','STATENS'],axis=1)
dfState.columns = ['state','state_abv']

df = pd.merge(df,dfState[['state','state_abv']],on='state',how='left')

#define threshold for dangerous cities that are in the .95 quantile 
dangerThreshold = df['ViolentCrimesPerPop'].quantile(.90)
df[df['ViolentCrimesPerPop'] >= dangerThreshold]


#get the state's avg crime rate 
stateAvgCrime = df.groupby('state_abv')['ViolentCrimesPerPop'].mean()
stateAvgCrime = pd.DataFrame(stateAvgCrime).reset_index()

```
